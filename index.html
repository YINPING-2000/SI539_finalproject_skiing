      <div class="reflection-content">
          <p class="reflection-intro"><em>Some emotional thoughts written on the plane...</em></p>

          <p>
            If you want to write about skiing, you can't <em>just</em> write about skiing.<br>
            Write about the wind whistling in your ears, the crunch of edges carving the snow.<br>
            Write about the freedom and silkiness brought by speed and centrifugal force during skidded turns and carving.<br>
            Write about the diverse scenery of the ski resort captured in photos.<br>
            Write about the layered pine forests, the weathered rocks, and the safety nets I bent crashing into them.<br>
            Write about practicing drills alone, counting turns out loud, the hard work and willingness to be lonely from the first lift to the last call.<br>
            Write about the seriousness and focus when discussing techniques with friends on chairlifts, during meals, or while walking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond these, there is so much I cannot forget.<br>
            I can't forget the fear and anxiety about speed in the first few days.<br>
            I can't forget those few seconds of airtime the first time I flew off a park kicker.<br>
            I can't forget the falls, the bruises, and the pain in my knees.<br>
            I can't forget the daily grind, and the excitement when Bolo praised my progress at dusk.<br>
            I can't forget Bolo's teachings—his praise for my execution, and his scolding that I only do well when he's watching.<br>
            I can't forget waxing boards in the room, and that walk through the neighborhood carrying them back to the car at midnight.<br>
            I can't forget the comfort and freedom of our conversations in the car returning from Beidahu; that atmosphere was precious.<br>
            I can't forget the Cantonese songs in the car, the exhaustion that put me to sleep instantly, and the movies, ramen, malls, and coffee on rest days.<br>
            I can't forget the hugs with everyone when leaving, and everyone's reactions.<br>
            I can't forget the great friends I made, the life ideals we discussed, the ideas exchanged, and the debates we had.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are all reluctant to part, understanding each other without words, yet we must say goodbye.<br>
            In my future life, it might be hard to find another block of time like this, dedicated entirely to skiing and playing. <br>
            Friends of this season, we might not meet again for a long time—at least three years. <br>
            I don't know what to wish for you, so I'll just say: Good morning, good afternoon, and good night.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having experienced so many goodbyes, I thought I had become cold, but this time feels harder.<br>
            I don't know if I'm forcing the sadness for the sake of poetry, or just having an emotional night, or maybe seeing everyone else so reluctant makes me unable to hold it back.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wrote all this because I fear forgetting these scattered details. I feel these days are a crucial memory in my life.<br>
            New memories might overwrite old ones, but at least what is written down won't be.<br>
            They say don't get stuck in memories, but memories make up our lives. It will take a long time to digest this period I loved so much.<br>
            Facing goodbye, I want to say more, but I don't know what else is left to say.
